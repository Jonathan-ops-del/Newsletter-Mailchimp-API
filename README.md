# Newsletter-Mailchimp-API
Using Node.js & Https with the third party Mailchimp API to create our Newsletter Application

The purpose of this Web Application is to demonstrate the use of our third party API provided by Mailchimp into our own Web Application. When a user signs into our Web Application, we are able save the user credentials into a third party site,

- https://mailchimp.com/ -. The owner of the Web Application, this being me, will be able see all the registered contacts in my own mailchimp account. Mailchimp provides us with an API that allows us to post our users information into their own site.

To complete this simple Web Application we use Node.js & Https primarily.
